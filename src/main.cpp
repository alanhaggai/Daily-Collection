 *
 * \a Daily \a Collection is a software which manages the daily accounting
 * activity of small banks
 *
 * Initial version (0.01) of the software was written in
 * <a href='http://perl.org/'>Perl</a> by making use of
 * <a href='http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/'>WxPerl</a> which is a port of
 * <a href='http://wxwidgets.org/'>WxWidgets</a>. The software has been
 * rewritten in <a href='http://www.qtsoftware.com/products/'>Qt 4.5</a> as
 * there was much difficulty in packaging the earlier software.
 *
 * This version includes the fix for the infamous bug in Daybook/Balance.pm
 * which resulted in several queries being executed in a loop and thus slowing
 * the entire application, which could be mistook for a crash.
 *
 * <tt>-- The difference makes the difference --
